- Accurate 6502 CPU emulation
- PPU graphics rendering with vertical/horizontal mirroring
- ROM loading with support for iNES format
- Audio stub (in development)
- macOS-native UI using Swift and SwiftUI
- Modular Swift codebase for easy extension and testing

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- macOS 14 or later
- Xcode 16 or later
- Swift 5.9+
- A valid NES ROM file (iNES format)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash

3. Build and run the app from Xcode.

## ðŸ§¹ Code Style â€“ SwiftFormat

This project uses [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) to enforce a consistent code style.

### ðŸ“¦ Installing SwiftFormat

Install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install swiftformat
```

### ðŸ›  Using SwiftFormat

To format all Swift files in the project:

```bash
